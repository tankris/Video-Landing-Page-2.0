# Video Landing Page 2.0

This is a Responsive website that runs a background video on the front page.

This is a re-implementation of [Video Landing Page](https://github.com/tankris/Video-Landing-Page). The purpose being to strengthen what I had previously learnt but without the use of the tutorial.

The site is currently deployed on GitHub pages and can be viewed [here](https://tankris.github.io/Video-Landing-Page-2.0).
